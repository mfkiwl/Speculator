.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B HybridReverb2
is a reverb effect using hybrid impulse convolution.
.br
.B HybridReverb2
is a convolution-based reverberation effect which combines the superior sound 
quality of a convolution reverb with the tuning capability of a feedback delay 
network.
.br
The sound quality of a convolution reverb depends on the quality of the used 
room impulse responses.
.br
.B HybridReverb2
comes with a set of room impulse responses which were synthesized with tinyAVE, 
an auralization software which was developed at the Institute of Communication 
Acoustics, Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Borß and Martin, 2009; Borß, 2009a).
.br
These room impulse responses are designed for a speaker setup with two 
front and two rear speakers (Borß, 2009b).
.br
.br
For a full surround sound effect, you will need two plugins, one plugin which 
uses a "front" preset for the front channels and a second plugin which uses 
the corresponding "rear" preset for the rear channels.
