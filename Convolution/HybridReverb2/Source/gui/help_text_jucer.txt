&#10;  Preset File:&#10;&#10;  This XML file defines the preset set.&#10;  (default: HybridReverb2_presets.xml)&#10;&#10;&#10;  Latency:&#10;&#10;  HybridReverb2 convolves the input signal with room&#10;  impulse responses which are partitioned into segments&#10;  of different size. This option specifies the size of the&#10;  initial segments which introduce a certain processing&#10;  latency. A small segment size results in a lower latency&#10;  at the cost of a higher computational complexity. An&#10;  effect plugin for musical instruments requires signal&#10;  processing with low latency. If the latency is not relevant&#10;  for your application, you can choose a larger segment&#10;  size for better performance.&#10;&#10;&#10;  Segmentation Strategy:&#10;&#10;  &#34;Uniform Processing Load&#34;: This strategy tries to avoid&#10;  processing load peaks at the cost of a slightly higher&#10;  mean processing load. This is the recommended choice&#10;  for signal processing with low latency.&#10;  &#34;Lowest Mean Processing Load&#34;: This strategy results in&#10;  the best overall performance. This is the recommended&#10;  choice for offline rendering.&#10;
