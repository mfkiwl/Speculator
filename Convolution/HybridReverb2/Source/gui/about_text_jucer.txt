&#10;  About Me and HybridReverb2:&#10;&#10;  As a research associate at the Institute of Communication&#10;  Acoustics, Ruhr-Universit&#228;t Bochum, Germany, I'm currently&#10;  persuing a Dr.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering.&#10;  I benefited from free and open source software for so many&#10;  years that I felt that I should give something back to the&#10;  community. As I'm working in the field of virtual acoustics&#10;  and spatial audio, writing a room effect plugin kind of&#10;  suggested itself. I hope you enjoy the sound as much as I&#10;  do!&#10;&#10;  Best regards,&#10;  Christian Bor&#223; <christian.borss@rub.de>&#10;&#10;&#10;  Credits:&#10;&#10;  - Julian Storer for his JUCE library&#10;  - The development team of the Jucetice project (jost, juced,&#10;    etc.)&#10;  - Matteo Frigo, Steven G.
