MATLAB codes for estimating the room impulse response (RIR) and exemplar weights for speech dereverberation in noisy environments using the NMF and NMD -based techniques detailed in [1].

Written by Deepak Baby, KU Leuven, September 2015.

Codes are also available in https://github.com/deepakbaby/dereverberation in case there are further changes
