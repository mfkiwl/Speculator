# OverlappingFFTProcessor
 This class takes care of buffering input and output samples for your FFT processing. You can specifiy the fft-length, hopsize, and also the used window.
 It's a header-only implementation, which relies on the JUCE framework. An exemplary JUCE project using this class is also included in this repository.
