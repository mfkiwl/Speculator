/**
  * @class Bands
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to calculate the sum of values in a given set of weighted bands.
  *
  * This class represents an object to perform calculatinos of band values.
  * The value of a band corresponds to the sum of the values of the input array in the band's
  * positions multiplied with the band's weights.
  *
  * In this implementation the positions of a given band are defined by the index of the first
  * array cell of the band and the size of the weights array.
  * The full configuration of the bands algorithm is defined using a single column matrix for the
  * starts of the bands and a vector of single row matrices for the weights each band.
  *
  * Note that the number of rows of the starts matrix and the size of the vector of weights must
  * be the same, and this will be the number of bands.
