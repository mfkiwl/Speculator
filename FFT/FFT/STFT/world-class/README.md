# A C++ library of WORLD - a high-quality speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis system

WORLD is free software for high-quality speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis.
It can estimate Fundamental frequency (F0), aperiodicity and spectral envelope and also generate the speech like input speech with only estimated parameters.

This source code is released under the modified-BSD license.
There is no patent in all algorithms in WORLD.

WORLD is originally developed by Masanori Morise,
and please see the following sites if you want to
know more details about WORLD.
- [An official HP of WORLD](http://www.kki.yamanashi.ac.jp/~mmorise/world/english/index.html)
- [An original repository of C language implementation](https://github.com/mmorise/World)

## Features

- You can reuse class objects (I know it's just only natural..)
- You can use OPENMP to parallel processing
- Processing speed is little faster than original C code (I think..)
- The name of namespace is idiotic..
