- Add a default parameter to all setters, such as 
  setFoo(typeA a, typeB b, bool setup = true)
  This would allow to do several sets with out penalizing 
  performance due to multiple setups.

- Switch from MatriXR and MatrixXC inputs, to MatrixBase< Derived >.
  This would avoid unnecessary copies, and the possibility to call functions
  on expressions such as Map, Block, etc.
