/**
  * @class PeakTracking
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to find peak trajectories in vectors of Complex values representing FFT, given peak
  * positions and peak magnitudes.
  *
  * The algorithm finds a maximum number of peak trajectories and returns 
  * the positions of the trajectory positions (in fractional index units) and the trajectory magnitudes (in decibel units) in
  * separate matrices.
  * 
  * The maximum number of trajectories can be specified using setTrajectoryCount().
  * 
  * The algorithm operates by matching the peaks in the current frames to the existing trajectories.
  * During the matching process a maximum frequency change of a peak can be specified using setMaximumFrequencyChange().
  *
  * The matching process also requires a trajectory to stay unmatched during a given number of frames for the trajectory to
  * disappear and leave a slot for another trajectory to be found.  The number fo silent frames can be specified using
  * silentFrameCount().
