/**
  * @class IFFT
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to perform an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform of a vector of Complex 
  * values representing the positive frequencies half of a symmetric FFT.
  *
  * The IFFT is a fast implementation of an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).
  * The algorithm takes as input (M / 2 + 1) point vectors of Complex 
  * values (M being the FFT size), and returns N point vectors of Real 
  * values (N being the frame size).
  *
  * The input of the IFFT is assumed to be the positive frequencies half of an M point
  * magnitude symmetric and phase antisymmetric FFT.  Therefore the result is a Real value 
  * vector.
  *
  * Note that N can be smaller than M.
  * In this case the last ( M - N ) coefficients
  * will be discarded, since it assumes that zero padding has been made
  * at the end of the frame prior to the forward FFT transform.
  *
  * Alternatively the algorithm can undo the center zeropadding and
  * the N/2 rotation if done durnig the FFT forward transform.
  * This is specified by using the setZeroPhase() method.
