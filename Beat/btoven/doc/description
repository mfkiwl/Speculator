BTOVEN Description
Griffin Milsap, Motalen 2011

BTOVEN is a musical signal processing library.  Given a PCM stream, BTOVEN will run an analysis and report many important musical parameters in REAL TIME such as:

* Tempo (BPM) (Ala Shierer et. al.)
* Click Track (Ala Shierer et. al.)
* Transient Detection (Custom Implementation)
* Current Intensity
* Sectional Intensity (Custom Implementation)

And will support musical concepts involving tonality in the near future such as
* Dominant Note Detection
* Chord Detection

BTOVEN is optimized for both desktop and embedded use, with optimizations made for signal processing technologies and hardware.  (DSPs, ARM NEON, x86_ASM Optimizations)
