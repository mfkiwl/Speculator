USAGE

If your system can provide frequency-domain data (e.g. by performing FFT on the
input audio), then to perform onset detection you only need onsetsds.h and 
onsetsds.c. These need no additional libraries beyond the standard C libraries.

If you aren't already doing the FFT then you can also use onsetsdshelpers.c
and onsetsdshelpers.h, which can process raw audio, from a buffer or from a 
file. These require two additional libraries:

 * libsndfile - I used version 1.0.17
   http://www.meganerd.com/libsndfile
   
 * FFTW 3 (floating-point version) - I used version 3.1.2
   http://www.fftw.org 

See the HTML documentation for a worked example.
