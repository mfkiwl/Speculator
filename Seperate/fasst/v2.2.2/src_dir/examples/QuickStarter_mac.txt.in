Welcome to FASST @FASST_VERSION@!
FASST is now installed on your computer at the following location: @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@

This installation provides three examples to show FASST usage. Example scripts are located in dedicated folders (example1, example2 and example3) in the same folder as this quickstarter file.

This installation provides three examples to show how to use FASST. Example scripts are located in dedicated folders (example1, example2 and example3) in the same folder as this quickstarter file.

Examples overviews:
Example #1 is an example of FASST source separation script dealing with an instantaneous mixture of 3 tracks (piano, voice and drums). Example #1 script is available for Matlab and for Python.
Example #2 is an example of FASST source separation script dealing with a simulated 8-channel anechoic mixture of 2 speakers (Example #2 script is available for Matlab only).
Example #3 is an example of FASST source separation script dealing with a real 8-channel reverberated mixture of 2 speakers (Example #3 script is available for Matlab and Python).

Detailed descriptions of corresponding audio scene and input parameters can be found in dedicated .m and .py file headers.

### How to run an example? ###
- With your file explorer (or with the terminal) go to the desired example folder
- Execute the .py script (only available for example #1 and #3) or the .m script (Matlab user)

### PEASS backend ###
Example #2 can use an optional backend named PEASS (Perceptual Evaluation methods for Audio Source Separation, available at http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/peass/PEASS-Software.html) for performance evaluation.
This backend should have been downloaded, installed and compiled during the FASST installation process. 
However, this installation step may have failed, in which case you should have received an error status.
In this case, find below the different error logs and some advice to resolve them.

## ERROR[1] Unable to download PEASS ##
This error can be caused by :
    1. An internet connection problem
    2. A problem while checking PEASS sources and third-parties repositories

To resolve these issues, follow the guidelines below:
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Check you can manually download the zip files provided at:
        http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/peass/PEASS-Software-v2.0.1.zip
        http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/download/demo/adaption-loops/adapt_loop.zip
    3. After steps 1. and 2. have been checked successfully, run again the installation script (see the "How to run PEASS installation script" section below)

## ERROR [2] Can not find Matlab in your PATH ##
This error can be caused by :
    1. A problem while calling MATLAB in command line

To resolve this issue, follow the guidelines below:
    1. Verify that MATLAB is installed and install it if needed. 
    2. Update your bash_profile file to add the path to your Matlab application. The bash_profile file is a hidden file. one way to modify it is the following :
        - Open a new terminal;
        - cd to your home directory
            > cd ~
        - Open your bash_profile with textedit (for example):
            > open -a TextEdit .bash_profile
        - Add the following line (must be modified to correspond to your configuration):
            export PATH=“<YOUR_MATLAB_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/bin:$PATH"
        For instance, the default MATLAB directory for MATLAB 2017a is : /Applications/MATLAB_R2017a.app/
        - Close all terminals and start a new one (for modification to be taken into account)
    3. After steps 1. and 2. have been fulfilled successfully, run again the installation script (see the "How to run PEASS installation script" section below)  

## ERROR [3] Problem while compiling mex function(s) ##
This error can be caused by :
    1. An exception because you don't have installed Xcode
    2. A conflict between your Matlab version and your Xcode version

To resolve this issue, follow the guidelines below:
    1. Check the compatibility between your Matlab version and the supported Xcode version 
        - Visit: https://fr.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/previous_releases.html
        - In the "Platform Availability" field, open the pdf file corresponding to your Matlab version
        - Click on "View general system requirements" at the beginning of the file
        - Switch to the Mac section and have a look to Xcode requirement.
    2. Install or update Xcode (or Matlab) to make the compatibility effective
    3. After steps 1. and 2. have been fulfilled successfully, run again the installation script (see the "How to run PEASS installation script" section below)
    
## How to run PEASS installation script ##
- Open a new terminal;
- cd to this folder (where this quickstarter is located);
- Execute the script named install_peass: 
    > install_peass.sh
