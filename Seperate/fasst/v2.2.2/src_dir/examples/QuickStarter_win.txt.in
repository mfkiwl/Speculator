Welcome to FASST @FASST_VERSION@!
FASST is now installed on your computer at the following location: @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@

This installation provides three examples to show how to use FASST. Example scripts are located in dedicated folders (example1, example2 and example3) in the same folder as this quickstarter file.

Examples overviews:
Example #1 is an example of FASST source separation script dealing with an instantaneous mixture of 3 tracks (piano, voice and drums). Example #1 script is available for Matlab and for Python.
Example #2 is an example of FASST source separation script dealing with an 8-channel anechoic mixture of 2 speakers (Example #2 script is available for Matlab only).
Example #3 is an example of FASST source separation script dealing with an 8-channel reverberated mixture of 2 speakers (Example #3 script is available for Matlab and Python).

Detailed descriptions of corresponding audio scene and input parameters can be found in dedicated .m and .py file headers.

### How to run an example? ###
- With your file explorer (or with the terminal) go to the desired example folder
- Execute the .py script (only available for example #1 and #3) or the .m script (Matlab user)

### PEASS backend ###
Example #2 can use an optional backend named PEASS (Perceptual Evaluation methods for Audio Source Separation, available at http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/peass/PEASS-Software.html) for performance evaluation.
This backend should have been downloaded, installed and compiled during the FASST installation process. 
However, this installation step may have failed, in which case you should have received an error status.
In this case, find below the different error logs and some advice to resolve them.

## ERROR[1] Unable to download PEASS ##
This error can be caused by:
    1. An internet connection problem
    2. A problem while checking PEASS sources and third-parties repositories

To resolve these issues, follow the guidelines below:
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Check you can manually download the zip files provided at:
        http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/peass/PEASS-Software-v2.0.1.zip
        http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/download/demo/adaption-loops/adapt_loop.zip
    3. After steps 1. and 2. have been checked successfully, run again the installation script (see the "How to run PEASS installation script" section below)

## ERROR[2] Unable to find Matlab in your PATH ##
This error can be caused by:
    1. A problem while calling MATLAB in command line

To resolve this issue, follow the guidelines below:
    1. Verify that MATLAB is installed and install it if needed. 
    2. Update your PATH environment variable: 
        - Follow this tutorial to edit the PATH environment variable: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
        - Add a new entry corresponding to the path of your Matlab installation (bin directory):
            For instance, the default MATLAB directory for MATLAB 2017a is: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2017a\bin
    3. If steps 1. and 2. have been fullfilled successfully, run again the installation script (see the "How to run PEASS installation script" section)  

## ERROR[3] Unable to compile mex function(s) ##
This error can be caused by:
    1. An exception because you don't have installed a C/C++ compiler
    2. A conflict between your Matlab version and your C/C++ compiler version

To resolve this issue, follow the guidelines below:
    1. Check the compatibility between your Matlab version and the C/C++ compiler version
        - Visit: https://fr.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/previous_releases.html
        - In the "Platform Availability" field, open the pdf file corresponding to your Matlab version
        - Click on "View general system requirements" at the beginning of the file
        - Switch to the Windows section and have a look to Xcode requirement.
    2. Install or update your compiler (or Matlab) to make the compatibility effective
    3. If steps 1. and 2. have been fullfilled successfully, run again the installation script (see the "How to run PEASS installation script" section)
    
## How to run PEASS installation script ##
- Open a new terminal;
- cd to this folder (where this quickstarter is located);
- Execute the script named install_peass: 
    > install_peass.bat
