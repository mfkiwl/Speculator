/**
  * @class MFCC
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to calculate the Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients of vectors of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to perform a 
  * Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) on vectors 
  * of Real values.  Which is a useful technique creating a sparse representation
  * of a spectrum magnitude.  The algorithm estimates a set of M coefficients
  * which should be similar for perceptually similar sounds.
  *
  * The MFCCs are calculated by taking the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) 
  * of the values of the Mel log powers.  The Mel log powers are calculated 
  * by applying the logarithm to the vaules of the Mel Bands (MelBands). The Mel Bands
  * are triangular overlapping windows applied on the power spectrum mapped onto the
  * Mel-frequency scale.
  *
  * The sampleRate and FFT size of the input spectrum are specified using setSampleRate() and
  * setFftSize().
  *
  * The frequency limits of the Mel scale mapping are specified using setLowFrequency() and
  * setHighFrequency().
  *
  * The number of Mel bands is specified using setBandCount().
  *
  * The number of resulting DCT coefficients is specified by setCoefficientCount().
