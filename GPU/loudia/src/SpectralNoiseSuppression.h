/**
  * @class SpectralNoiseSuppression
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to remove the non-harmonic part of the spectrums magnitudes represented as vectors of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to perform spectral noise suppresion on vectors
  * of Real values.  Which is a useful technique to keep only the peaks of a spectrum magnitude
  * in harmonic sounds.
  *
  * This implementation consists in estimating the spectral noise by performing a
  * moving average on the power warped spectrum magnitude using varying bandwidths.
  * The spectral noise is then removed from the original spectrum, clipping the result to zero to avoid
  * negative values.
  *
  * The sampleRate and FFT size of the input spectrum are specified using setSampleRate() and
  * setFftSize().
  *
  * The frequency limits of the Mel scale mapping are specified using setLowFrequency() and
  * setHighFrequency().
