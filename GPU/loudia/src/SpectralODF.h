/**
  * @class SpectralODF
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to perform onset detection functions on vectors of Complex values representing the FFT of a signal.
  *
  * This class wraps several kind of spectral Onset Detection Functions (ODF).  A spectral onset detection function is 
  * a function mapping from an FFT of an audio signal to a Real value.  The onset detection function represents a value
  * proportional to the probability of the frame being an onset.
  *
  * The algorithm takes as input N-point vectors of Complex values 
  * and returns Real values.
  *
  * 5 types of ODF methods are implemented:
  * -# Spectral flux
  * -# High frequency content
  * -# Phase deviation
  * -# Weighted phase deviation
  * -# Normalized weighted phase deviation
  * -# Modified Kullback-Liebler
  * -# Complex domain
  * -# Rectified complex domain
  * -# Peak center of gravity
  *
  * The Phase deviation, Weighted phase deviation, Normalized weighted phase deviation, Complex domain and 
  * Rectified complex domain methods require the 2 past FFT frames.
  * Therefore if any of these methods are specified, the process() method would require an input matrix of at least 3 rows 
  * and will output ODF values for all the rows but the first two.
  *
  * The Spectral flux method requires the past FFT frame.
  * Therefore if this method is used, the process() method would require an input matrix of at least 2 rows 
  * and will output ODF values for all the rows but the first.
  * 
  * The ODF method can be selected using the 
  * setOdfMethod() taking as argument an ODFMethod.
  *
  * This function is often use to perform beat estimation and event segmentation tasks.
