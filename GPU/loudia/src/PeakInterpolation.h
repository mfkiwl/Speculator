/**
  * @class PeakInterpolation
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to interpolate peaks in a vector of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to interpolate peaks in a vector of Real values.
  * The algorithm interpolates the positions and magnitudes of a set of peaks, given
  * the original frame, peak positions and peak magnidutes.
  *
  * The interpolation consists in fitting a parabola (quadratic interpolation) on the 
  * point of the peak and the two points surrounding it. 
  *
  * Note that the interpolation is performed in the decibel domain, and in order to 
  * avoid innecessary transformations the resulting interpolated peak magnitudes
  * are returned in decibels.
