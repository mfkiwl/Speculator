/**
  * @class BandFilter
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to create and apply several types of low pass, high pass, 
  * band pass and band stop filters.
  *
  * This class represents an object to create and apply several types of band filters.
  * Additionally the coefficients, zeros, poles and gains of the created filters
  * can be retrieved.
  *
  * 4 types of bands are implemented:
  * -# Low Pass
  * -# High Pass
  * -# Band Pass
  * -# Band Stop
  *
  * The band type can be selected using the 
  * setBandType() taking as argument a BandType.
  *
  * The critical frequencies are specified using 
  * setLowFrequency() and setHighFrequency().
  * Note that for low pass and high pass filters which have one single critical frequency
  * only setLowFrequency() has an effect.
  *
  * 4 types of filters are implemented:
  * -# Chebyshev I
  * -# Chebyshev II
  * -# Bessel
  * -# Butterworth
  *
  * The filter type can be selected using the 
  * setFilterType() taking as argument a FilterType.
  *
  * The order of the filters can be specified using setOrder().
  *
  * For Chebyshev I filters the pass band ripple can be specified using
  * setPassRipple().  Note that this method has no effect if
  * a different type of filter is used.
  * 
  * For Chebyshev II filters the stop band attenuation is specified using
  * setStopAttenuation().  Note that this method has no effect if
  * a different type of filter is used.
