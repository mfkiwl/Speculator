# PhaseVocoder
A C++ based phase vocoder example that allows pitch and timescale modifications of audio files. Built using the Juce framework.

The plan is modernize the code base with current best practices, both C++ and Juce wise. 
Ideally I'd like to extend it to use higher quality phase locking algorithms for improved sound quality.
Also to include more effects than just pitch and timescale modifications.
Basically a spectral effect tool would be the end goal, possibly creating a plugin out of the result.

This was initially written back in 2010 for my thesis project to showcase the PV algorithm and it's uses.
