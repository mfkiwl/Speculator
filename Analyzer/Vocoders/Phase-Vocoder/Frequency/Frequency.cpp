 *   \section desc_sec Description
 *   This class provides a few functions to automate the mapping of an
 *      arbitrary frequency to the set 88 piano key frequencies. Depending
 *      on the platform it may be simpler to use the names of keys, e.g.,
 *      C4 or G6, instead of frequencies or key numbers. This class allows 
 *      the user to reference a key by frequency, key number, or key name.
 *      It's primary purpose is to be a helper class for a pitch correction
 *      module in order to simplify the process of determining the final
 *      intended pitch.
