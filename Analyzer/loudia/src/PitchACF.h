  * @brief Algorithm to estimate the most prominent pitch of a vector of
  * Real values reprsenting the FFT of an audio frame using the 
  * Autocorrelation function.
  *
  * This class represents an object to estimate the most prominent pitch 
  * of a vector of Real values reprsenting the FFT of an audio frame using 
  * the Autocorrelation function.
  *
  * The algorithm performs an autocorrelation on the input spectrums
  * and finds the first peak of a set of highest magnitude candidates.
  * The index of the peak and the values of the peak will determine the
  * pitch frequency and saliency.
  * 
  * The minimum peak width can be specified using setMinimumPeakWidth().
  * 
  * The number of candidates at the peak detection stage be
  * specified using setPeakCandidateCount().
