/**
  * @class NMF
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to calculate the Non-negative Matrix Factorization of a 
  * matrix of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to perform a 
  * Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on a matrix 
  * of Real values.  Which is a useful technique for decomposing multichannel
  * signals into linear independent components and their respective positive gains.
  * 
  * The algorithm estimates a set of M temporal independent components, each of which
  * is represented as a single row in a matrix of the same number of columns as the
  * input matrix.
  * The algorithm also estimates a set of M time-varying positive gains, 
  * each of which is represented as a single column in a matrix with as many rows
  * as the input matrix.
  *
  * In order to implement the NMF an iterative multiplicative update rule is applied in order
  * to minimize the distance from the multiplication of the gains and components matrices
  * to the input matrix.
  *
  * The distance minimized in this implementation is the Kullback-Liebler divergence.
