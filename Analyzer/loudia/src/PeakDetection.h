/**
  * @class PeakDetection
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to find peaks in a vector of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to find peaks in a vector of Real values.
  * The algorithm finds a maximum number of peaks and returns 
  * the indices of the peaks and the values of the peaks in
  * separate matrices.
  * 
  * The maximum number of peaks can be specified using setPeakCount().
  * 
  * The resulting peak arrays may be sorted by position or by magnitude. This can be
  * specified using setSortMethod().
  *
  * When sorting by position it may be interesting to specify a number of candidates, in order
  * to perform a preselection of the highest valued peaks before sorting.  This can be specified
  * using setCandidateCount().
  *
  * The implementation consists in running a sliding windows along the vector in search of 
  * indices which whose value is the maximum of the window.  The size of the window
  * defines the minimum width of the peak.
  *
