/**
  * @class LPC
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to calculate the Linear Predictive Coding of vectors of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to perform a Linear Predictive Coding on vectors 
  * of Real values.  Which is a useful technique for estimating a parametric representation
  * of a spectrum magnitude.  The algorithm estimates a set of M coefficients of a IIR filter
  * whose frequency response approximates the vector of Reals passed as input.
  *
  * This algorithm implements the Levinson-Durbin recursion for solving the
  * following linear equation system:
  *
  * R a = r
  *
  * where R is the Toeplitz matrix made of the first M - 1 autocorrelation 
  * coefficients of the input vector and r is a vector made of M - 1 
  * autocorrelation coefficients starting from the second of the input
  * vector.
  *
  * Optionally a pre-emphasis FIR filter may be applied to the input vector
  * in order to enhance estimation of higher frequencies. The pre-emphasis filter
  * consists of a 2 coefficient filter of the form b = [1, -b1] where usually:
  *
  * 0.96 <= b1 <= 0.99
  *
  * The b1 coefficient defaults to 0, but can be specified using setPreEmphasis().
