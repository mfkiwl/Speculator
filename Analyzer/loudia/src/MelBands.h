/**
  * @class MelBands
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to get the band values of Mel-scale frequency warpped magnitude spectrums.
  *
  * This class represents an object to Mel bands on vectors
  * of Real values.  This method is a special case of the Bands algorithm and is used
  * in many other spectral algorithms such as MFCC and SpectralWhitening.
  *
  * The method consists in a set triangular 50% overlapping windows spaced evenly on a
  * Mel-frequency scale.
  *
  * The sampleRate and FFT size of the input spectrum are specified using setSampleRate() and
  * setFftSize().
  *
  * The frequency limits of the Mel scale mapping are specified using setLowFrequency() and
  * setHighFrequency().
  *
  * The number of bands is specified using setBandCount().
