/**
  * @class SpectralWhitening
  *
  * @brief Algorithm to whiten the magnitude of spectrums represented as vectors of Real values.
  *
  * This class represents an object to perform spectral whitening on vectors 
  * of Real values.  Which is a useful technique to make the peaks of a spectrum magnitude 
  * stand out in harmonic sounds.
  *
  * This implementation consists in calculating the Mel bands and create a linear interpolation
  * between these to be used as a wheighting parameter of the spectrum's compression. 
  *
  * The sampleRate and FFT size of the input spectrum are specified using setSampleRate() and
  * setFftSize().
  *
  * The frequency limits of the Mel scale mapping are specified using setLowFrequency() and
  * setHighFrequency().
  *
  * The number of Mel bands is specified using setBandCount().
  *
  * The compression factor of the whitening process is specified by setCompressionFactor().
