## About the documentation

There are 3 main parts in the documentation:
1. The main page, which is README.markdown
2. The related pages, which are markdown files located in doc/
3. The pages generated by _doxygen_ from the comments in the code

To generate the documentation, simply hit `make doc` in the build/ directory. The HTML files will be located in build/doc/html/. You will need a recent version of _doxygen_ (available here: [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html).
