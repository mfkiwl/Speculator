This directory contains the openBliSSART documentation.

First of all, a reference manual, including a tutorial, is included. It can be
found in the directory doc/manual, and is compiled using LaTeX: 

$ pdflatex manual
$ bibtex manual 
$ pdflatex manual 
$ pdflatex manual

Note that you have to use 'pdflatex', not 'latex'.

Second, if you want to use the openBliSSART libraries, you should consult the
HTML documentation of the framework API, which can be created by the doxygen
utility. This can be done either by issuing 

$ make html 

in the *top-level directory*, or explicitly running doxygen:

$ doxygen doc/doxygen.cfg

After that, open the file doc/html/index.html in your browser.
