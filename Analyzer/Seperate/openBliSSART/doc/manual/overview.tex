openBliSSART is a framework and toolbox for Blind Source Separation for Audio
Recognition Tasks. Main features include

\begin{itemize}
\item Component separation using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
  \cite{LeeSeung1999,Smaragdis2003,LeeSeung2001} and non-negative matrix deconvolution
  (NMD) \cite{Smaragdis2004}
\item Component classification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature extraction from components
    \item Creation of response variables assigning audio components to classes
    \item Assembly of audio files for different
    classes, such as in drum beat separation \cite{Virtanen2005}
\end{itemize}
\item Supervised and unsupervised NMF feature extraction
\item Data export (ARFF \cite{Weka} and HTK \cite{HTKBook} formats)
\end{itemize}

\begin{leftbar}
In many places in this document and the applications, NMF and NMD are used
as synonyms. The reason is that mathematically NMF is a special case of NMD.

The remainder of this manual is divided into three chapters.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:Tutorial} provides a brief introductory tutorial on how to
use openBliSSART for typical blind source separation tasks.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:RefManual} explains the data storage architecture and
algorithmic concepts of openBliSSART in detail. The manual is concluded by a
detailed description of the openBliSSART toolbox, its command line parameters
and configuration options in Chapter~\ref{chapter:Toolbox}.

For detailed information about how to use the classes in the openBliSSART
framework, please consult the HTML or LaTeX documentation in the {\tt doc}
directory of the openBliSSART source distribution, which can be created using
the {\tt doxygen} utility.
