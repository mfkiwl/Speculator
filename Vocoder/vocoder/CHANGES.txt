-------------------
1.0 (December 1996)
-------------------

Official release.  Works flawlessly (yeah, right).

--------------------
1.0.1 (January 1997)
--------------------

Minor changes to fft/error.c to allow to make definitions of emalloc() and
ecalloc() agree with the prototyes.

Updated the README to reflect the existance of a MacOS version (which is
a bit different from the others).

----------------
1.1b1 (July 1998)
----------------

Mostly re-written.

Support for AIFF files.

Dramatic reduction in memory use.  Amount of memory used is now proportional
to the window length instead of the size of the input files.

Improved quality.  S's and T's come out much more clearly.
Chanks to Tero Karras <tkarras@ksilta.edu.ouka.fi> for the tip!

Intelligent defaults for most of the command-line arguments.

The Java version has been discontinued.

-------------------
1.2 (March 1999)
-------------------

If no command-line arguments are passed, it will ask the user for the
values of all the parameters.

A small off-by-one error has been fixed.  Thanks to Matthew Frank Toews
<mtoews@interchange.ubc.ca> for pointing it out to me.

-------------------
1.3 (September 2002)
-------------------

Added GUI version for Win32.
